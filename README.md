# How to Run Full U-Net Fine-tune

1. Download the pretrained model from:  
   https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base  
   Place the downloaded files in the `data/pre_model` directory.

2. Download the clip model from:  
   https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32  
   Place the downloaded files in the `data/CLIP` directory.

3. Install the required environment:  
   Open a terminal in the `code` directory and run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_1.txt

4. Run the experiment:
In the code directory, execute:
   ```bash
   python3 auto_experiments.py --experiments_name=ff_test

This will load adversarial samples generated by our method and use them to fine-tune the full U-Net.
The fine-tuned model will generate images saved to:
`data/generated_images/full_finetune/`
You can check the output images to evaluate the results.

# How to Run LoRA + Dreambooth and Textual Inversion

1. Create and activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n dreambooth39 python=3.9 -y
   conda activate dreambooth39

2. Install diffusers from source in the environment:  
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git

3. Install the required environment:  
   Open a terminal in the `code` directory and run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_2.txt

4. Run the experiment:
In the code directory, execute:
   ```bash
   python3 auto_experiments.py --experiments_name=dl_ti_test

This will load adversarial samples generated by our method and use them to fine-tune the full U-Net.
The fine-tuned model will generate images saved to:
`data/generated_images/full_finetune/`
You can check the output images to evaluate the results.

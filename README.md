# How to Run

1. Download the pretrained model from:  
   https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base  
   Place the downloaded files in the `data/pre_model` directory.

2. Download the clip model from:  
   https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32  
   Place the downloaded files in the `data/CLIP` directory.

3. Install the required environment:  
   Open a terminal in the `code` directory and run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the experiment:
In the code directory, execute:
   ```bash
   python3 auto_experiments.py --experiments_name=ff_test

This will load adversarial samples generated by our method and use them to fine-tune the full U-Net.
The fine-tuned model will generate images saved to:
`data/generated_images/full_finetune/`
You can check the output images to evaluate the results.
The corresponding evaluation metrics will be saved in the `result` folder, which you can also review.

# Note 

1. `ff_test` are command collections located in the `experiment` folder.  
If you need more flexible execution or want to customize experiment settings, you can modify these files accordingly.
